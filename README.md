# Haze Removal Techniques for
Image Processing


Fog removal methods (Approax & Default)- This method combines the retinex algorithm and wavelet transform algorithm to remove FOG content from the digital images in densely traffic


Contrast Enhancement (for Colour & B&w hazy image)- Contrast enhancement of color images is typically done by converting the image to a color space that has image luminosity as one of its components, such as the L*a*b* color space.


Low Light Enhancement (Basic method and Advance method)- These images can have low dynamic ranges with high noise levels that affect the overall performance of computer vision algorithms. (Currently working on this method)
